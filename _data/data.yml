RESEARCH INTERESTS:
    details: |  My research interests lie at the intersection of networked systems and protocols, information theory and statistical modelling. During my PhD studies, I have developed SCDP, an efficient data transport protocol for data cen- tres. SCDP builds on RaptorQ coding and is tailored for one-to-many and many-to-one data transfer patterns, which are extremely common in modern data centres. SCDP does so without compromis- ing on efficiency for short and long unicast flows. SCDP achieves this by integrating RaptorQ codes with receiver-driven data transport, in-network packet trimming and Multi-Level Feedback Queuing (MLFQ); (1) RaptorQ codes enable efficient one-to-many and many-to-one data transport; (2) on top of RaptorQ codes, receiver-driven flow control, in combination with in-network packet trimming, en- able efficient usage of network resources as well as multi-path transport and packet spraying for all transport modes. Incast and Outcast are eliminated; (3) the systematic nature of RaptorQ codes, in combination with MLFQ, enable fast, decoding-free completion of short flows. The work is in collabo- ration with Prof Crowcroft (University of Cambridge) and has appeared as a poster in ACM SIGCOMM 2018 and is currently under revision for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking. In collaboration with Dr Clegg (QMUL), we have conducted one of the most comprehensive studies on Internet traffic in the literature and is unique with respect to the spatial and temporal diversity of the studied Internet traces. Through rigorous statistical analysis of publicly available traces, we showed that the log-normal distribution is the best fit for Internet traffic volume. The work has major impact on designing models for researching networking problems, SLA provisioning and 95th-percentile pricing for ISPs. The work was published (reviewed in top 5% amongst 1464 papers) at the flagship IEEE networks conference with a follow-up submission in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking. As part of my work with Mavis Broadcast Ltd, I am researching reliable video streaming protocols with the ability to run optimised digital signal processing mechanisms on cloud streamed data. This is crucial for broadcasters who are challenged with the data transport often not being efficient for high-end broadcast applications.
